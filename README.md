# MEng_Project_Arm
The purpose of this code is to control (and monitor) Dynamixel MX-64AR smart servos. It is designed to work with Arduino Mega (ATmega2560) and MAX485 TTL to RS485 module. The code is based on work by Mark Khordi-Moodi as a part of his dissertation completed in 2018.
# Version 0.2:
Implemented 3 buttons that control the move of the robotic arm. 1st button toggle between two motors and the other 2 buttons adjust the angle down and up of the connected segment (link): [motorSelect][down][up].
